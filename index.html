    <h3>So what is communism?</h3>
    <p style="width: 50%;">Communism, political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the
    natural resources of a society. Communism is thus a form of socialism—a higher and more advanced form, according to its
    advocates. Exactly how communism differs from socialism has long been a matter of debate, but the distinction rests
    largely on the communists’ adherence to the revolutionary socialism of Karl Marx.</p>

    <h3>Let's deep dive into socialism!</h3>
    <p style="width: 50%;">Socialism is a populist economic and political system based on collective, common, or public ownership of the means of
    production. Those means of production include the machinery, tools, and factories used to produce goods that aim to
    directly satisfy human needs. In contrast to capitalism, whereby business owners control the means of production and pay
    wages to workers to use those means, socialism envisions shared ownership and control among the laboring class.
    In a purely socialist system, all production and distribution decisions are made by the collective, directed by a
    central planner or government body. Worker cooperatives, however, are also a form of socialized production. Socialist
    systems tend to have robust welfare systems and social safety net so that individuals rely on the state for everything
    from food to healthcare. The government determines the output and pricing levels of these goods and services.
    
    Socialists contend that shared ownership of resources and central planning provide a more equal distribution of goods
    and services and a more equitable society.</p>
